## Installation

### If you're using After Effects CC 2019 or above:
In After Effects go to **File > Scripts > Install Script**, locate the script file you downloaded, and click the Select button.

If successful, you'll receive a notification to say that the script has been copied to your preferences folder. At this point you need to Restart After Effects.

Once you've restarted After Effects your script will show up at the bottom of the "Window" menu.

### If you're using an older version of After Effects:
For older versions, you'll need to carry out a few more steps. If your script still isn't showing after you've carried the following steps out, check the common problems section below.

#### Step 1. Put your script in the After Effects script folder
This will vary slightly depending on whether you're using a Mac or Windows machine:

##### For Mac users
Copy the "missing_files.jsx" script file to the after effects scripts folder located here:

Applications\After Effects (your version here)\Scripts

##### For Windows users:
Copy the "missing_files.jsx" script file to the Windows version of the after effects scripts folder:

Program Files\Adobe\Adobe After Effects (your version here)\Support Files\Scripts

#### Step 2. RESTART AFTER EFFECTS
You need to close After Effects down and re-open it in order for it to recognise your script.

#### Step 3. Open your script in After Effects
Your script should now show up at the bottom of the "Window" menu in After Effects

## Usage

## Future Plans

- Create a panel with values for old location and new location (e.g. restore folder) to automatically check which of the files are already restored and which are missing
